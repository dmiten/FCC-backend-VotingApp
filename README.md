## Voting App
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 
[this]( https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com).
 Then deploy it to Glitch.<br>
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch 
project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit 
[this](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).<br>
<br>
Here are the specific <b><i>user stories</i></b> you should implement for this project:
<br>
 - As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
 - As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
 - As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
 - As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
 - As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
 - As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
 - As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
 - As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
